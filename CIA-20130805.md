* _Personal opinion_
	* _This could be an alternative in the future to give UI insights, esp. in the financial data visualization vertical._
	* _To support my point, here is [a great data viz project](http://visual.ly/vizbox/startup-universe/, "The Startup Universe") provided by Visual.ly, which uses the same data format as we do with __Crunchbase__. [This link](http://vc-interactive-lb-393591138.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/vc-webapp/api/v3/relations/su/google) shows what this project returns by querying "Google". After playing with it for a whilte, I found there are only 4 concepts involved: person, vc, startups, categories. In all, to some extent this project implements the financial knowledge graph idea._
